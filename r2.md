# RealtimeVoiceAPI - Modern Python Framework for OpenAI's Realtime API

## 🎯 Project Vision

We're building a next-generation Python framework for Realtime AI Chat APIs (works with  openai voice mode apis elevenlabs etc but for now we are focused on OpenAI only and dont care about others)

This framework is an realtimevoiceapi engine and it provides all required features for interacting with voice api. 


this framework also solves the fundamental tension between **ultra-low latency** and **feature richness**. by providing 2 implementations using strategy method. fast line strategy for fast voice interactions when needed and big lane is where business logic calculations can happen no in real time and there might be delay but more intelligence conversion occurs. 



## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Key Innovation: Automatic Mode Selection

The framework automatically chooses the optimal path:
- **Fast Lane**: Direct audio capture → minimal VAD → immediate streaming
- **Big Lane**: Full audio pipeline → event-driven → rich features

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Core Architecture** ✓
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Protocol definitions for audio, streaming, and providers
- Type-safe implementations with dataclasses and enums

### 2. **Fast Lane Components** ✓
- `DirectAudioCapture`: Hardware-level audio capture with triple buffering
- `FastVADDetector`: Energy-based VAD with <1ms per chunk processing
- `FastStreamManager`: Direct WebSocket streaming with minimal overhead
- Pre-allocated buffers, no allocations in hot path

### 3. **Big Lane Components** ✓
- `AudioPipeline`: Composable audio processing with priority-based processors
- `EventBus`: Async event-driven communication with pattern matching
- `StreamOrchestrator`: Multi-stream coordination with load balancing
- `ResponseAggregator`: Intelligent response assembly from chunks

### 4. **Audio Processing** ✓
- Base64 encoding/decoding optimized for speed
- Audio chunking with configurable sizes
- Format validation and conversion
- Quality analysis with speech detection

### 5. **Session Management** ✓
- Session lifecycle tracking
- Usage metrics and cost estimation
- Multi-provider support architecture

### 6. **Message Protocol** ✓
- Full OpenAI Realtime API message support
- Type-safe message creation and validation
- Efficient serialization/deserialization

## 📊 Current Test Status

2. **Adoption**: 1000+ GitHub stars and active community
3. **Production**: Used in production by 10+ companies
4. **Features**: Support all OpenAI Realtime API features plus extensions

## 🛠️ Technical Decisions

### Why Dual-Lane Architecture?
- Single implementation can't optimize for both latency and features
- Automatic selection removes complexity from users
- Clean separation allows independent optimization

### Why Not Mock WebSockets?
- Real implementation reveals actual performance characteristics
- Integration issues surface early
- More confidence in production readiness

### Why Modular Design?
- Easy to test components in isolation
- Can swap implementations (e.g., different VAD algorithms)
- Clear ownership and responsibilities

## 🤝 Contributing

We need help with:
- Audio processing optimizations
