I wanted to find a good voice api framework for python which could work in high demand voice apps

in general what makes realtime voice api is :
WebSocket is bidirectional**: Unlike HTTP, messages flow both ways continuously and Events are asynchronous therefore Responses don't follow a strict request→response pattern and Audio/text arrives in chunks, not complete messages. 

I come up with this 5 layer architecture. 

Key Insight: Event Streams, Not Request/Response. Instead of request/response, use stream contracts:
The Key Principle: "Thin Shared Interfaces"


 1. User speaks
microphone → AudioEngine → validates/processes → StreamEvent(AUDIO_INPUT)

# 2. Send to provider
StreamEvent → LLMStreamManager → OpenAIAdapter → WebSocket

# 3. Provider processes and responds
WebSocket → OpenAIAdapter → translates events → StreamEvent(AUDIO_OUTPUT)

# 4. Play response
StreamEvent → AudioEngine → buffers/processes → Speaker

# All while tracking costs
CostTracker monitors all usage across the pipeline


Benefits of This Architecture

Provider Agnostic: Easy to add new providers (Anthropic, Google, etc.)
Stream-Native: No forcing request/response on streaming APIs
Cost Transparency: Built-in tracking across all providers
Flexible Pipelines: Can mix providers (e.g., OpenAI for LLM + ElevenLabs for TTS)
Event-Driven: Natural fit for real-time communication
Testable: Can mock providers easily

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Scalability**: Can handle multiple concurrent conversations
2. **Maintainability**: Clear module boundaries
3. **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new stream types or handlers
5. **Performance**: Non-blocking, efficient stream processing

This architecture respects the realtime nature while providing clean abstractions.
